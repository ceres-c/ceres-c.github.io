Here I'll try to irregularly post part of the things I enjoy doing. Given that I always feel like nobody *really* cares about the things I do, most articles are short. Probably **too** short. If something seems to be off in a thing I have written, it's most certainly not your fault, but mine: I might have forgotten an important part, or I could very well be plainly wrong. Fire me an email, please!

Theoretically I'm a Software Engineer, but I really don't like to code: I do it only if I really have to. Breaking stuff is a lot of fun, though.

LaTeX is great and sooner or later I might transform this whole website in a single pdf file in a typesetting-frenzy raptus.

Also, I like to hike.
